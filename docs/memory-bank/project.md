# Project Context

The `memory-bank/project/` directory contains project definition and strategy documentation.

## Files

### projectbrief.md

Defines the project's core identity:

- Mission statement
- Project goals and objectives
- Scope and boundaries
- Target audience

Generated from `package.json` analysis and AI inference about the project's purpose.

### productContext.md

Describes the product context:

- Problem statement - what issue the project solves
- Solution overview - how the project addresses the problem
- User personas and workflows
- Key differentiators

## Generation

These files are generated by `shelly memory init` using the `AIContentGenerator` class, which analyzes your project structure and `package.json` to produce accurate context.

## Updating

```bash
# Update all project context files
shelly memory update

# Update a specific file
shelly memory update --file projectbrief.md

# View current content
shelly memory show project/projectbrief.md
```
