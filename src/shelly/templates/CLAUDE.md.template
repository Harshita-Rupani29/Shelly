## Project Overview

**{{projectName}}** - {{description}}

- **Package Name**: {{packageName}}
- **Repository**: {{repoName}}

## Essential Development Commands

### Building

```bash
npm run build              # Compile/build the project
npm run clean              # Remove build artifacts
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint               # Run linter (ESLint)
npm run lint:fix           # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format             # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check       # Check formatting without changes
npm run typecheck          # Run TypeScript type checking
```

### Development

```bash
npm start                  # Start the application
npm run dev                # Start in development mode with hot reload
```

## High-Level Architecture

<!--
This section should describe the key architectural patterns and design decisions.
Update this based on your project's specific architecture.
-->

### Core Concepts

- **Entry Point**: The main application entry point
- **Services**: Business logic and external integrations
- **Utils**: Shared utility functions and helpers
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces

### Key Design Patterns

- Describe the primary patterns used (e.g., dependency injection, repository pattern, etc.)
- Note any important architectural decisions and their rationale

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines
3. Write/update tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
6. Submit a pull request

### Commit Convention

This project uses conventional commits for semantic versioning:

- `feat:` - New features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking changes (major version bump)

## Key Files to Know

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Main entry point |
| `package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript compiler options |
| `.eslintrc.*` | Linting rules |
| `.prettierrc` | Code formatting rules |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD pipeline definitions |

## Important Constraints

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Ensure proper type annotations (avoid `any` when possible)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests should be deterministic and not rely on external state

### Dependencies

- Minimize adding new dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained packages with good security records
- Document why new dependencies are needed in PR descriptions

### Performance Considerations

- Be mindful of bundle size impact
- Avoid synchronous operations that could block
- Consider memory usage for large data processing

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development/production/test) | No |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug logging | No |

## Common Gotchas

1. **Build Before Test**: Always run `npm run build` before testing if you've made TypeScript changes
2. **Import Extensions**: If using ESM, remember to use `.js` extensions in imports even for TypeScript files
3. **Node Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version (check `engines` in package.json)
4. **Environment Setup**: Some features may require environment variables to be configured

## Getting Help

- Check the README.md for general documentation
- Review existing code for patterns and conventions
- Look at test files for usage examples
- Check issue tracker for known problems and solutions
